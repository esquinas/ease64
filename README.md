# Ease64 - Base64 for humans

Ease64 is a [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64 "Base64 in the English Wikipedia") alternative that can be encode/decode by humans hands. This means: no error-prone math operations like addition (like uuencode) and also no arbitrary look-up tables. 

Look at the code or wait until I finish writing this README.
