# Ease64 (alpha). Base64 for humans

Ease64 is a [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64 "Base64 in the English Wikipedia") alternative that can be encoded/decoded by hand. This means: no error-prone math operations like addition (uuencode) and no arbitrary look-up tables. All that's needed is a regular ASCII-octal table for both encoding and decoding.

Look at the code or wait until I finish writing this README.

## Example

Classical "Man is distinguished" plain text:

```plain
Man is distinguished, not only by his reason, but by this singular passion from
other animals, which is a lust of the mind, that by a perseverance of delight
in the continued and indefatigable generation of knowledge, exceeds the short
vehemence of any carnal pleasure.
```
Encoded:
```plain
IiaMp MIsDAdMIsNaiMqgNiiNYhLidE  MqoN  MynMayDAbOH MAiNX NQeLIsMynE  LQuN  LQyDAtMAiNX NYiMqgNilLIrDApLIsNYiMynDAfNQoMhJMytMAeNP LInMImLIlNXlDAwMAiLYhDAiNX LH MauNYtDAoLp NahLh MiiMqdE  NahLItDAbOH LH NAeNQsLivLirLInLYeDAoLp LaeMaiLyhN JMInDAtMAeDAcMynNaiMquLidDAaMqdDAiMqdLifLItMIgLIbMaeDAgLinLirLItMIoMp MyfDAkMqoNylLidLyeE  LixLYeLidNX NahLh NYhMyrN JNqeMAeMieMqcLh MyfDAaMqyDAcLIrMqaM  NAlLiaNYuNQeEp
