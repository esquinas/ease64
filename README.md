# Ease64 (alpha). Base64 for humans

Ease64 is a [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64 "Base64 in the English Wikipedia") alternative that can be encoded/decoded by hand. This means: no error-prone math operations like addition (uuencode) and no arbitrary look-up tables. All that's needed is a regular ASCII-octal table for both encoding and decoding.

Look at the code or wait until I finish writing this README.
